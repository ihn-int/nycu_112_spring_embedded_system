# Final Project

Title: Simple Monitor for RPi and other micro controller.
Motivation:
- Only few output devices are taught in class.
- VNC Monitor and HDMI are powerful, but too complicate.
=> Let's make a simple monitor!

You can view the slide on canva: [link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGHPiue09A/7R70EwWCocQlMR6vInIa6A/edit?utm_content=DAGHPiue09A&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton), which contains the demo videos.

## Content

### On Arduino Uno

A simple text display experiment is shown with Arduino Uno.
The other test is for image display. Here I let the screen display the qrcode, but the result isn't satisfied.
> check "./finalProject" and files with in

### On Raspberry Pi

A simple animation is displayed with Raspberry Pi.
> check "bad_apple_time_fixed.py"

### tools

The "tools" folder only contains some files that I used to create the animation file. 

Hereby declare: "pgm2int.c" file is modified from "ppm2mem.c", which was used in DLab class in NYCU.
