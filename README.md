## Lab

The repository for NYCU 112 Fall Embedded Systems Capstone.

This is the collection of all the code used in the class, both in labs and the final project. The only exception is Lecture 8, cross-compile, since the compiled kernel is too large to upload. Some code used for lab demonstrations is modified from sample code received from the professor, so some discrepancies are to be expected.

No comments are written for the lab code, as they are quite simple.

# Final Project
For final project information, please read the README.md in the "final_project" directory.
